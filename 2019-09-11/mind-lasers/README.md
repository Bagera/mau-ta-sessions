# Mind Lasers

Mind lasers is an example of using the webcam, a canvas and TensorFlow (tfjs) with the Coco ssd model to find the brains (roughly) to draw lasers between peoples minds. We also calculate the maximum distance any of these lasers shoot.

The example is based on the `camera -> ml-coco-ssd` project in [Clint Heyer's Interactivity repo](https://github.com/ClintH/interactivity).

## Running the project

**WARNING! The demo takes a long time to start. The model is very big.**

To run the server start a _Live Server_ or similar in this repo and go to [http://localhost:5050/2019-09-11/mind-lasers](http://localhost:5050/2019-09-11/mind-lasers). The portnumber `5050` may be different on your computer.
