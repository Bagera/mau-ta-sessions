# interactivity

A collection of sketches designed to be simple and easy to extend. They demonstrate using the web platform for experimenting with interactivity.

We've attempted to make each sketch folder self-contained, with the idea that you simply make a new copy of the folder every time you want to make a different sketch.

## Running

Before attempting to use a sketch, check its folder for a `README.md` file which explains what it is, how it works and gives links for further reading. Some sketches require additional steps before they will do anything.

Sketches should work on desktop or mobile platforms, but no guarantees are made.

Use Visual Studio Code and the "Live Server" extension to boot up sketches and run them in a browser. A service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) can be used to make your sketches runnable on a different device. In many cases, you can also use [Glitch](https://glitch.com) to host your work.
